# Trigger

## Introduction
The application was designed to help users track possible triggers of you common health conditions. Users can add foods and reactions, logging them by day and time using a simple user interface.  By tapping on the days or arrows in the date navigator, the user can go to previous days and view foods consumed and past reactions.  Also, the analytics page will give the user useful information about possible triggers sorted by frequency and likelihood of being connected to the condition.    

## Initial Setup

These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Home Page

When a user first visits the page, they see an index of foods and reactions for the current day, sorted by time.

#### Adding new Foods or Reactions
When a user taps on the green `+` button at the bottom of the page, a form will emerge where the user can choose between foods or reactions, enter a name, add the time when the food was consumed and click submit to add the item to the current date displayed on the center of the date navigator.

When the analytics is displayed, the user can scroll through the different reactions (displayed at the top of the screen) using the arrows on the sides. Below, the app will display the occurrences of the reaction in different periods of time. Also below, the user will see a scrolling component with the potential triggers. A frequency percentage is displayed for each potential trigger, indicating the likelihood that the food is related to the reaction, relative to other foods. At the bottom right corner of the page there is an help button (`?` icon) that will display relevant information about the analytics page when clicked.
